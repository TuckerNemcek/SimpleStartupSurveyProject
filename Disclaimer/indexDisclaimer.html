    <h1 class="page-title text-center"> Disclaimer </h1>

        <p>The Simple Financial Health Check assumes Accrual Accounting basis (rather than Cash Accounting). Accrual Accounting is the preferred accounting basis as it provides a more precise picture of the health of your business at any point in time even if cash has not changed hands.</p>

        <p>Cash Accounting affects things like COGS and Inventory. For example, imagine you purchased $25,000 worth of Raw Materials in January for a $50,000 order in February. Under Cash Accounting, you would have a $25,000 loss in January and a $50,000 Sale in February with no COGS. This reality distorts ratio analysis which is why the Financial Health Check assumes Accrual Accounting.</p>


        Please be advised Accrual Accounting is required by the IRS if you carry inventory (as opposed to a service business with no inventory), if you are structured as a C Corporation, or of your sales exceed $5 Million.

        The final disclaimer is the Simple Financial Health Check assumes reporting accuracy.
